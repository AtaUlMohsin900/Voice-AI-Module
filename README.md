# Voice-AI-Module

 Frontend – Ship clean, reusable React / Next.js components that handle microphone access, status feedback, and whatever UX you propose for speech capture and playback. SSR should remain intact and Lighthouse scores can’t drop.

• Backend – Stand up new FastAPI endpoints that receive audio streams, call the recognition logic, and return results with low latency. The code must be fully typed, documented, and covered by basic tests.

• Voice layer – Plug in best-fit speech-to-text and text-to-speech engines (open-source or cloud, I’m flexible) so we can recognise spoken phrases and synthesise responses. Accuracy and cost efficiency are both important.

• Integration – Make frontend calls seamless through WebSocket or REST, whichever yields the smoothest real-time experience. CORS, auth tokens, and error handling need to be airtight.

• Performance – Benchmark round-trip time, add caching or queueing where it helps, and keep memory/CPU footprints sensible so we can containerise and auto-scale later.

Deliverables are a Git repo with modular code, a one-page setup guide (Docker-compose preferred), and a short Loom walkthrough showing the feature in action.
